Welcome to the Shelta 1.2 FreeDOS disk image for v86!

* To compile EG\HELLO.SHE to EG\HELLO.COM, type

    bin\shelta n eg\hello    ('n' means: use NASM-source compiler)

  then run

    eg\hello

* To build the bootstrapped compilers, type

    bin\bootstrp

  Then you can build sources with the bootstrapped compilers:

    bin\shelta s eg\99       ('s' means: use stage 1 bootstrapped compiler)
    bin\shelta s2 eg\demo    ('s2' means: use stage 2 bootstrapped compiler)

* You can also edit Shelta sources with the 'ted3' text editor, like so:

    edit eg\99.she
