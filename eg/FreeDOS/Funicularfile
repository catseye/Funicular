Phase 2
-------

Create a floppy image (360K, 720K, or 1.44M) for use in v86 or elsewhere.
Obviously, this is not big enough for most dev tools, but we can squeeze
a few in.

*   Back on the host, run `./create-fda-image.sh` to make a floppy image
    (enter either `0.36`, `0.72`, or `1.44` for size)

*   Run `./start-freedos.sh`

    *   run `D:\INITFLOP`.
    *   enter `360`, `720`, or `1440` as appropriate.
    *   select to install `yasm` or not, as you desire.  (requires 720!)
    *   select to install `perl` or not, as you desire.  (requires 1440!)
    *   When finished, quit QEMU.

*   Run `./start-freedos.sh floppy` to confirm that the floppy image boots.
    Then just quit QEMU.

We now have a bootable floppy image with a few basic tools on it.  We can
"outfit" it with something more interesting.  And while we could do this
from the guest FreeDOS instance, parts of it are easier to do from the host,
using `mtools`.

### Shelta ###

*   Create a 720K floppy, as described above.  Elect to install `yasm` on it.

*   Back on the host, run `toolshelf dock bb:catseye/shelta` if you haven't
    got it.

*   Run `./outfit-floppy-shelta.sh`

*   Run `./start-freedos.sh floppy` to confirm that the floppy image boots.
    And test `shelta` on it.  Then just quit QEMU.
