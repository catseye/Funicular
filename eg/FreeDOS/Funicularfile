* As explained in the script, it may take more than one attempt to format
  the image correctly, if it has never been used before.
* The result will be a generic, bootable FreeDOS floppy.  You may
  wish to make a backup copy of "a.img" to not need this step in future.
* To populate the floppy with a few basic things, run "POPUFLOP".

You now have a bootable floppy image with a few basic tools on it.

* To populate the floppy with a project distribution, run the "MAKEDIST.BAT"
  batchfile in the appropriate "SKEL" subdirectory.  For example, to make a
  Shelta distribution, run "SKEL\\SHELTA\\MAKEDIST".
